# github-commits-test


## Description
The goal of this test will be to create an app that shows git commit history on the same public repository you are working on.
You need to do well-stated and defined commits while working on this test and regularly push them up. No need to make the app able to access a private repository.

This project uses [Nest.js](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) for the server and [React.js](https://react.dev/) for the client.
